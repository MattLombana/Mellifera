# Mellifera

Mellifera: A Honeypot designed with simplicity in mind, written in python 3.
The name draws inspiration from the scientific name of the Western American
Honey Bee. (Apis Mellifera). Since this is one of the few species of bees that
make honey, it seemed like a fitting name.

## Installation

```shell
virtualenv -p python3 <virtualenv_name>
cd <virtualenv_name>
. bin/activate
git clone https://github.com/MattLombana/Mellifera
cd Mellifera
pip3 install -Ur requirements.txt
```

Make sure to replace `<virtualenv_name>` with a name for your virtual
environment. I like to use reponame-virt. In this case reponame would
be replaced with Mellifera ie, I use Mellifera-virt

## Configuration

There are several files to configure before Mellifera can be run. They are:
